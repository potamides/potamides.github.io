I am a doctoral researcher advised by [Prof. Dr. Steffen
Eger](https://nl2g.github.io/team#Steffen_Eger) at the [University of
Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en), where I study the limitations of
large language models in resource-constrained multimodal and multilingual
settings. I received my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree with honors in
Computer Science from the [Technical University of
Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp).

My specific focus is the intersection of [multimodal
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_learning) and neural
[program synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_synthesis),
particularly in *graphics program synthesis* with vision-language models. This
emerging field explores how multimodal AI systems can generate programs that
compile to visual media. Visit my [playground](playground) for an interactive
example of this technology in action.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been fortunate to receive mentorship
from [Dr. Adrien Kaiser](http://www.adrienkaiser.fr) and [Prof. Dr. Tamy
Boubekeur](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/boubek) during my internship at
[Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com) in France, and [Prof. Dr. Masao
Utiyama](https://www2.nict.go.jp/astrec-att/member/mutiyama), [Dr. Hideki
Tanaka](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=V72tg8UAAAAJ), and [Dr. Raj
Dabre](https://prajdabre.github.io) during my internship at the [National
Institute of Information and Communications
Technology](https://www.nict.go.jp/en) in Japan. I am also grateful to [Prof.
Dr. Philipp Cimiano](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZyR3798AAAAJ),
[Prof. Dr. Simone Paolo
Ponzetto](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/professors/prof-dr-simone-paolo-ponzetto),
and all my collaborators for their guidance and support.

Beyond academia, I actively contribute to and maintain various free
and open-source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/potamides). I
occasionally share research insights, personal projects, and other updates on
my [blog](blog).

University](https://www.skku.edu/eng)).
